## About

Made by Muhib Ali. Aspiring Software Engineer. Attending McMaster University for Software Engineering and Management Co-op, currently in his second-year of university. Learning full-stack and creating 3 full-stack apps.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create two random passwords for the user. 

The program's base functions so far give you two 15-character passwords after clicking the "Generate passwords" button found in the program. In the future, this program will be improved to allow the user to choose the number of characters wanted in their passwords, as well as if they want to exclude symbols or numbers from their generated passwords.

This project was created with the help of Scrimba's Fullstack Path that Muhib Ali is enrolled in.
